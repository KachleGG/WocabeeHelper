## 🎮 How It Works

1. **Indexing**: When you view vocabulary packages, the extension automatically extracts and stores word pairs
2. **Detection**: It detects when you're in an exercise (selection, typing, game, or test)
3. **Matching**: It finds the current question word and looks up translations in its database
4. **Helping**: Based on exercise type:
   - **Selection**: Highlights the correct answer with a green glow
   - **Typing**: Shows a hint bubble with the correct answer
   - **Games/Tests**: Shows answers in the control panel

## ⚙️ Control Panel Options

- **Auto Highlight**: Automatically highlight correct answers (default: ON)
- **Show Hints**: Display hint tooltips (default: ON)
- **Auto Answer**: Automatically click/type answers (default: OFF ⚠️)

## 🔧 Customization

Edit `utils/config.js` to:

- Adjust selectors for DOM elements
- Change timing delays
- Enable/disable debug logging

## 📝 Notes

- The extension needs to index words first before it can help - browse through your vocabulary packages!
- Selectors may need adjustment if Wocabee updates their website
- Word database is stored locally in browser storage
